## Write a short comment describing these functions

##
##  1. makeCacheMatrix creates a unique "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
##

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}

##  2. cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix function above. 
##           If the inverse has been calculated already then the matrix will not change, then the cachesolve should 
##            retrieve the inverse from the cache.
